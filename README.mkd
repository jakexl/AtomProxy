# Atom Proxy

It is a modified version of Sublime Proxy for Atom. It was forked from https://github.com/thinkrad/SublimeProxy

To install:

- Build it or use the prebuilt package found in Builds (was compiled on Mac OSX
10.11 64-bit)
- Put AtomProxy.app wherever you want
- Make sure original Atom.app is in the Applications folder
- Point Unity's External Editor setting at the AtomProxy.app

Now whenever you click on an error line in Unity it should open up to the
correct place in Atom!
